SQL Injection Articles
- Sanitizing input, the particular point I found important was that it is easier to "remove everything but known good data", almost like
  a whitelist for characters.

- Using stored procedures for database access, I think it is likely more robust to write a few good procedures or functions to access data
  rather than creating unique queries for each attempt to access a database.

- Stop using input as a literal string, instead of using string concatenation use functions that are already available, similar to the point 
  before use something that is robust and already tested rather than attempt to make it yourself poorly.
